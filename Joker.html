    <h1>Story</h1>

    <p>Party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. Gotham is rife with crime and unemployment. Arthur suffers from a neurological disorder that greatly affects his behavior in society: he is psychotically
        delusional has incoherent speech and tone, and shows inappropriate emotional responses to stressful situations (e.g., he can burst into uncontrollable laughter when nervous). After delinquents attack Arthur, his co-worker Randall gives him a gun
        for protection. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub. While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Arthur
        is fired when Randall lies to their manager that the gun was Arthur's own. On the subway, still in clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunk Wayne Enterprises businessmen; he shoots two dead in self-defense and wounds the third before pursuing
        him off the train and killing him as well. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, who calls those envious of more successful people "clowns." Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning
        clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shut down the social service program, leaving Arthur without his therapy and medication</p>
